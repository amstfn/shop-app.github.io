I have developed a professional e-commerce application using React, showcasing my skills in front-end development. This application demonstrates my expertise in utilizing React Router for seamless navigation between various pages, such as the home page, category pages, product listings, and product details.
Through the implementation of a well-structured application architecture, I have successfully created components for rendering product lists and displaying detailed information about selected products. These components efficiently retrieve and display relevant data from the Redux store, ensuring a smooth user experience.
To enhance interactivity, I have incorporated event handling for mouse interactions, allowing users to easily interact with the application and explore product offerings.
In terms of state management, I have employed Redux to effectively manage the application's state. This includes defining action types, creating action creators, and combining reducers to handle product-related data. The Redux store, created with support for the Redux DevTools extension, ensures a robust and scalable state management solution.
Furthermore, I have successfully integrated Axios to fetch product data from an API, demonstrating my ability to utilize external resources seamlessly within the application.
Overall, this e-commerce application highlights my proficiency in building responsive and user-friendly interfaces, implementing efficient state management with Redux, and integrating seamless navigation using React Router.
